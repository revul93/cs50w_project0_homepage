----- CS50W Project 0 -------
Author: revul93

Description:
This is a simple project for CS50W course by Harvard University
The main purpose is to pass the auto checker and get project0 accepted

I put some effort on index.html page, but then I get so bored writing a lot of html and css code
so I shortened a lot of things in the other pages


Please use this project as a judgement on my skills. Take a look at other projects. They are different!
